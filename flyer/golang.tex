Did you ever wanted a programming language that is productive and easy to use like Python, while being efficient like C or C++ and not having to despair on handling memory management? Then Golang is your way to go!
This workshop will serve as an introduction to the Golang programming language informing you about what it is, what the benefits are and what it can be used for.

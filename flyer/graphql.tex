Have you ever worked with REST API?
If so, you know how tedious it can become 
creating and managing all endpoints. 
GraphQL tries to solve this issue. It is a data query 
language developed by Facebook in 2012 before
being publicly released in 2015.
It provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible
alternative to REST and ad-hoc web service architectures.
It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server, therefore preventing excessively large amounts of data from being returned.

\section*{Students prepare execute Workshops}
In the course Enterprise Software Development, we apply the
flip-the-classroom approach. Teacher sit back, students teach. 

Our students will prepare a set of workshops, for which you find a short
description in the leaflet.

The selection of topics to choose from is set up by the teachers. The
focus is Java related technologies that are in vogue in the industry
at this moment (Autumn 2018).

\subsection*{All is Docker here}
All workshop projects should have at least one server component that is deployed
in one (or more)  docker containers.

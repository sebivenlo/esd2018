\section*{implementating BPMN with Camunda}

Camunda is a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) tool, used for creating diagrams displaying process procedures. In this workshop you will learn about the fundamentals of process modelling, the modelling possibiities of Camunda, and how to (semi-) automatize process models. In a given Docker environment, you are going to apply modelling techniques to visualize and automatize your own business process(es).

The example process is about a car dealer, seen at the workshop given by Capgemini. The knowledge of this workshop is used together with further experience in process design from the BPMN module.  The expected outcome is an easy to deploy application, spawning the container using docker-compose, the default web GUI of Camunda and external third party services connected to this in order to show the extendability of Camunda.
